# Frontend Mentor - Clipboard landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## OVERVIEW

- this was the first landinf page that i built and had lots of fun codding it.

- as i am still learning this was very helpful to me to practice layout using grids.

-i have used few extra colors for the project as i tried to code it exactly as the design.

- i learned the fundamentals of grids and now i am very confident about it.

- all of my code has different sections identified with a comment and it the flow of the code is in accordance with the contents of the page, i.e, one after the other. So i dont think anyone who wants to learn from my code will have any issue regarding it.
